The rcom ftplugin uses one of the following methods to evaluate R code:

    - RCom interface (http://rcom.univie.ac.at; Windows only)
    - RServe (requires +ruby and the rserve-client rubygem)
    - screeen/tmux via the screen plugin

After installation, interaction with R is enabled for all
buffers with filetype r. For other filetypes, you can use the
functions |rcom#EvaluateInBuffer()|.


Features:

    - Evaluate R code
    - Maps for normal, visual, and insert mode
    - Keyword map (|K|)
    - Operator

The following features are supported only with some methods:

    - Omnicompletion for R
    - Get return values from R


Caveats:

For the RCOM and rserve methods, it is recommended to set 
|g:rcom#server|. Depending on your OS, your version of ruby & R & 
rcom/rserve, this ftplugin may cause vim to hang or crash. When you run 
the R code via a second instance of GVIM, you won't suffer from such 
hickups. This also has the side effect that you can continue editing 
while R evaluates the code.

For the RCOM method, it is recommended to set |g:rcom#reuse| = 1 and to 
start an instance of RGui (Windows only) before initiating any 
communication via RCOM. 



Maps~

The ftplugin provides several maps (see also |g:rcom_map|, 
|g:rcom_mapp|) to evaluate R code and optionally print the result in 
normal, insert, and visual mode. There is also an operator (see 
|g:rcom_mapop|).


Normal usage~

    0.  Optional steps:
            a. Prepare a running instance of RGui if using the RCOM 
               method.
            b. RCOM and screen methods: The results get printed in the R 
               window. You might want to arrange the windows in a way, 
               so that you can see VIM, R console and R graphic device 
               at the same time.
    1.  Open an R source file in VIM.
    2a. Type <c-cr> to evaluate the current line/visual area in R.
    2b. Type [count]+ or +{motion} to evaluate some text in R. (You can 
        type ++ to invoke |+|.)
