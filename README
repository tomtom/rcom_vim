*rcom.txt*          Evaluate R (www.r-project.org) code via rcom (windows only)

This plugin is still experimental. During development it made vim hang 
from time to time. Please report any problem to the author. Thanks.

The rcom ftplugin uses the RCom interface (http://rcom.univie.ac.at)
to R for sending code to a running instance of R. This way any R
snippet can be easily evaluated in that instance of R.

After installation, interaction with R via rcom is enabled for all
buffers with filetype r. For other filetypes, you can use the
functions |rcom#EvaluateInBuffer()|.


Features:

    - Evaluate R code
    - Omnicompletion for R
    - Maps for normal, visual, and insert mode
    - Keyword map (|K|)
    - Operator


Caveats:

It is recommended to set |g:rcom#server| and |g:rcom#reuse| = 1.

Setting |g:rcom#reuse| = 1 is more stable. Depending on your version of 
ruby & R & rcom, g:rcom#reuse = 0 could make your gvim crash.


Maps~

The ftplugin provides several maps (see also |g:rcom_map|, 
|g:rcom_mapp|) to evaluate R code and optionally print the result in 
normal, insert, and visual mode. There is also an operator (see 
|g:rcom_mapop|).


Normal usage~

    1. Start an instance of R GUI and load the image you want.
    2. Open an R source file in VIM.
    3. Type <c-cr> to evaluate the current line/visual area in R.
    4. Type [count]+ or +{motion} to evaluate some text in R. (You can 
       type ++ to invoke |+|.)

By default, the results get printed in the R GUI window. You might want 
to arrange the windows in a way, so that you can see VIM, R console and 
R graphic device at the same time.


Two modes~

#1 Run as headless StatConnectorSrv:
    This is only useful when used from another library as you won't see 
    any output. Any output from a print command is inserted in the 
    result. If there is a .Rdata image in the same directory as the 
    current buffer, it is loaded.

#2 Re-use a running instance of R:
    If there is a .Rhistory file in the same directory as the current
    buffer, it is loaded. This is the default mode when enabling an R 
    buffer via |rcom#EvaluateInBuffer()|.

You can only connect to one instance of R at a time. If there are
several instances of R running ... well, good luck then. :-)
