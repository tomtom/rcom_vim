  - Method = screen: Support for gvim @ linux & gnome-terminal
  - g:rcom#reuse = g:rcom#method == 'rcom'
  - g:rcom#r_object_browser = 'str'

  - Improved timing (use msgwait=0 and sleep for g:rcom#screen#rcom_shell seconds in order not to miss a subsequent eval)
  - rcom#Quit(): Remove buffer-local autocommand
  - rcom/screen: set msgwait & msgminwait to 0 (reset on disconnect)
  - rcom/screen: When waiting for a response, also check the file size &, if mode == 'r', the file content
